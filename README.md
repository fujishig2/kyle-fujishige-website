# kyle-fujishige-website

This is my own personal portfolio website.

**The purposes for making this website are:**
- To learn React.js
- To learn Bulma css framework
- To have a Single Page Application
- To have an extendable website where every aspect is editable and extendable with no code (through the admin panel)
